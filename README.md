This repository is purely for educational and experimental purposes and not for commercial usage (at this moment). Each code and data sample in this entire repository is a byproduct of a curiosity driven approach looking for "What happens under the hood during the training and evaluation of machine learning models on the classic Iris dataset.". The code samples were running at the day of push but not guaranteed later on for various reasons e.g. Dependency Hell, Environment Issues, Version Changes, Deprecations and so on. DO Not Use for any Production or Organizational Use Case.

Foundational Classical Machine Learning Programs for Hands-On Learners. Primarily aimed for self-taught learners who are curious and ask questions (often in loops) to understand better as they go on learning journey through hands-on. Not recommended and not suitable for learners who wants to go quick and fast w/o thinking of need for explainability.
